RGB Foundation Model Training Script

Trains a 300-epoch RGB-only foundation model with heatmap channel forced to zeros.
This creates a strong baseline that can be loaded for any subsequent heatmap experiments.

Usage:
    ./train_rgb_foundation.sh
    
The resulting model will be saved to work_dirs/rgb_foundation_300ep/ and can be loaded
for any future experiments with:
    --cfg-options load_from=work_dirs/rgb_foundation_300ep/best_coco_bbox_mAP_epoch_*.pth
