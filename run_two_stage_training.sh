Two-Stage Training Script for RTMDet 4-Channel Model

This script implements the two-stage training strategy:
1. Stage 1: RGB-only training (heatmap = zeros) to establish visual features
2. Stage 2: Heatmap fine-tuning at reduced learning rate

Usage:
    ./run_two_stage_training.sh [stage1_epochs] [stage2_epochs]
    
Example:
    ./run_two_stage_training.sh 120 60
